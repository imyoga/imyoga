### 🚀 About Me
I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience building **scalable full-stack systems**, **real-time applications**, and **microservice architectures**.  

I work end-to-end across:
- 🧠 **Architecture & system design**  
- 🎨 **Frontend engineering (React, TS, UI/UX)**  
- 🛠 **Backend & APIs (Node.js, Python, distributed workflows)**  
- 📡 **Real-time data systems** using WebSocket, MQTT, TCP, Modbus  
- 🐳 **Docker-based microservices & cloud deployments**  

I use **AI-assisted workflows** to accelerate development: faster prototyping, cleaner code, automated testing, documentation, and performance improvements.

I enjoy building systems that are:
**fast, reliable, observable, scalable, and developer-friendly.**

### 🌟 Highlights & What I’m Good At
- Designing **scalable, event-driven architectures** for real-time dashboards and control systems  
- Building **low-latency streaming UIs** that visualize complex metrics and time-series data  
- Developing **microservices** that ingest, parse, forecast, and analyze large data flows  
- Integrating multi-protocol IoT/edge systems (WebSocket, TCP, MQTT, Modbus etc.)  
- Creating **developer tooling and automation** to improve engineering productivity  
- Owning products end-to-end: idea → architecture → code → deployment → monitoring  
- Leading and mentoring on **clean code, testing, patterns, and engineering practices**
